This project demonstrates various image processing techniques using Python 🐍, leveraging libraries like OpenCV and Matplotlib 📊. The focus of this project is on processing images through multiple steps, including color space conversion, histogram equalization, contrast and brightness adjustment, and histogram analysis.

The key features include:

Image Display 🖼️: Visualizing the original and modified images side by side to compare the effects of applied transformations.
Histogram Calculation 📈: Plotting histograms of image intensities to analyze the distribution of pixel values in both the original and processed images.
Color Space Conversion 🌈: Converting images from BGR (OpenCV default) to RGB for proper visualization in Matplotlib.
Brightness & Contrast Adjustment 🔆🔲: Modifying the brightness and contrast of images using simple scaling techniques and visualizing the effects on both the image and its histogram.
Histogram Equalization 🔄: Applying histogram equalization to improve the contrast of grayscale images.
The project provides a hands-on approach to image manipulation and analysis, using histograms to better understand how pixel intensities change during various processing steps.
